This is a script for merging dashcam footage. Specially for the BlackVue dashcam. The BlackVue dashcam records in increments of 1 minute. This is kinda annoying if I just want to watch a couple minutes of video without it getting interrupted. BlackView also mixes front and rear, as well as parking footage together. Here is a more detailed [explanation](https://helpcenter.blackvue.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055596392-What-types-of-recording-or-file-does-the-BlackVue-camera-create-)

 way I organized it is by if it has a P (which means parking. I don't want that, it is just a timelaspe of my car parked, where nothing happens) then I throw it out. If the video title has an F in it, which means Front, then I add that to the front list. If it has an R, then I add that to the Rear list. I then create text files for both front and rear that list all video files. From there I have ffmpeg concatenate the video files into one seamless video.
