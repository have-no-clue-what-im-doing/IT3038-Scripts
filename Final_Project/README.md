# Requirements and Dependencies:

This script checks to see if there is Newcastle United FC game for the day, and if there is, power on a remote computer and display the game.\
Useful little script that frees up like 30 seconds of my time each weekend :)\
I no longer have to check and see which network the game will be on nor turn on my TV and navigate to the proper channel. All done automatically. 

There are two versions of this script for either Windows or Debian based Linux\
To test this script you will need the following:

1 Windows computer to display the Newcastle game (as host)\
1 Windows / Linux computer to run the script (as client)

The host machine must have a NIC that allows Wake On Lan. Otherwise you will have to manually turn on the machine yourself before running the script\
If your NIC does have WOL you will have to enable it via the BIOS and also on the Windows network adapter settings.

Both machines will need `SSH`\
For most Linux distros it should be installed by default. If not you can run `sudo apt-get install openssh-client`\
For windows machines you will need to install [OpenSSH](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=powershell) \
Be sure to add firewall rules to allow SSH traffic.

For the Windows host machine, you need to enable [auto-login](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/user-profiles-and-logon/turn-on-automatic-logon)

Be sure to make note of the following on your host machine:\
`Username`\
`Password`\
`IP Address`\
`MAC Address`

Your host machine will also need Google Chrome installed in its default directory. 

For the following functions you will have to add in your own login and machine info:\
`PowerOnComputer`\
`RestartComputer`\
`CreateChromeShortcut`

Yes, having the password in plain text is bad practice, but this has already taken up enough of my time

Also ensure both machines are on the same broadcast domain so wake on lan works

You'll also need Peacock and YoutubeTV. Technically not if you just want to see if it work without watching the game.

# Installation

This script runs off of Python and Powershell. Your host machine must have Powershell and your client machine must have both Python and Powershell\
[Link to download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\
Powershell should be downloaded by default on Windows unless you disabled / uninstalled it

Before running the script, be sure to install all dependencies:\
First ensure pip is installed (It should be included with the Python install for Windows).\
For Linux:\
`sudo apt-get install python3-pip`


Now install all requirements:\
`sudo pip install -r requirments.txt` 

You may also need to manually install Beautiful Soup if you get an error regarding bs4:\
`sudo pip install BeautifulSoup4`

Also, very important, ensure all your pip packages are up to date, otherwise you could get some errors. 

If you're running the script off Linux you will also need wakeonlan, which can be installed here:
`sudo apt-get install wakeonlan`

Once all requirements are downloaded and installed you are good to run the script. Feel free to have this run via task scheduler or as a cron job. Best time would be in morning, a couple hours before 9am EST. 

# Video Demo & Code Overview

Here is a quick demo from today's match:\

Overview of Code:\

I made a small change right after the demo video. I took out locally creating the chrome shortcut and now have it created by using an ssh connection and creating it directly onto the host machine instead.
