# lab 7

For this lab I decided to use the winsound library. 

I've created 3 different functions that each play around with the beep feature built into Windows.

The first one, MusicPlayer, simply starts beeping at its lowest frequency and then raises the frequency of intervals of 100 until it gets to around 12,000. It will then loop back to the lowest frequency and it'll do this indefinitely 

The second function, GoingDeaf, just plays a continuous beep at an absurdly high frequency.

And the final function, PitchPerfect, beeps at random frequency and for a random amount of time. Great computer generated music!
